QoS with TC and Python
======================

When you are setting a QoS with TC with a shellscript, the syntax is not easy
to read. This tool tries to give a better way to interact with TC.

Dependencies
------------
  * python 2.7 or 3.4 (it certainly works with prior versions, just not tested)

Configuration
-------------

Copy the default configuration file `config.py.default` as `config.py`.
<b>Please do not modify or remove `config.py.default` if you cloned this
repository.  Always do your modifications in config.py.</b> Then modify
`config.py` for your setup (documentation is inside).

Usage
-----

QoS rules are is the `rules` folder, where there are some examples
corresponding to my actual setup. The source file `tools.py` contains all the
useful functions for rules, which are documented with docstrings.

A function `apply_rules()` has been created in `rules/__init__.py` to apply
all the rules once.

When your rules are created, just run `qos.py` :
```
python3 qos.py [option]
[option]:
    start: set QoS rules
    stop: remove all QoS rules
    show: show QoS rules
```
